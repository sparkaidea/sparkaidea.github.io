# Introduction to Neural Network

This article aims to demystify the theory behind Neural Networks and its design for everybody with little or no knowledge in a comprehensive manner. In this article, my goal is to explain the traditional definition, basic implementation, and real life examples of Neural         Networks. So, let’s start with some mundane examples - like playing your favorite show via Alexa or a driverless metro which can read a stop signal and halt at a desired location. The technology which implement these is nothing but the most powerful branch of Artificial Intelligence – Deep Learning. Now, you must be wondering why and how Deep Learning has become so indispensable to our daily life.
Well, to answer this question I would like to digress from the topic to know what is so deep about this learning. (:-D pardon my pun on this). Deep Learning aces on Neural Network, (also popularly known as Artificial Neural Network (ANN)) algorithms. This neural network is similar to our biological brain and so an untrained Neural Network is more like a brain of new born babies, as they are ignorant of the worldly things till it get revised with training data and grow to a mature human brain. Like human brain, neural network also employs same technique for training i.e., Learn by Example.

## Analogy between a Biological Neuron and Neural Network

Let’s us imagine the functionality of a biological neuron when someone pinches you. The dendrites of your neuron carry the sensation to the cell body like an input. These inputs then get processed by the cell and the axon carries the output, which is actually your reaction to the pinch.

Similar, functionality of neural network can be observed in the below diagram, which can help us predict the future of stock market or estimation of real estate property in future. The inputs (x0, x1, ……) are the considered factors for predicting the price of the property for example number of bedrooms, area of the property, location etc and each of these have an assigned weight which signifies the importance of these factors in determining the output, i.e, the price. Here, processing will employ the summation of all the inputs multiplied with their weights and the calculated output will the predicted price.

This is the simplest explanation of how neural network works. A lot of mathematical theory and calculations involved in this process. Also, there are multiple hidden layers between these input and output layer, making this process quite complex in nature but it improves the accuracy in prediction.

## Application of Deep Learning
Let’s start with a question, what first comes to your mind, when you need a quick language translation or just set up a quick meeting? Definitely, most of you come with the solution of Google Translator or virtual assistant. Most of us get auto-tagged in Facebook right, do ever wondered how you got automatically recognized? Don’t we love our Sunday binge watch and haven’t you got awestruck when Netflix started recommending your upcoming favorite shows and more. And keep naming it, I am sure the key technology behind these applications is Deep Learning. It is widely used in different specialized fields like banking, telecom or Medical Science etc.
